## Note
- The idea of this app is to use as many features as possible to explore the power of KMP (The app doesn't have to make sense ðŸ˜Š) so feel free to add or request any feature you like.
- The IOS still alpha currently (11/10/2023) so it is a bit laggy even with release.
- Can't record the Biometric Auth screen.
